        Family Details: Daughters - Rachel, 32, elementary school teacher; Sarah, 28, classical musician.\
        David was a history professor at a renowned university, famous for his lectures on the Renaissance era.\
        What’s important to you? For David, history was not just about events, but the people and emotions that shaped them. His lectures felt alive, with characters from the past coming to life in his classroom.\
        What’s happening for you at the moment? Recently, he\'s been jumbling up dates, sometimes even mixing up historical events. This has caused a few embarrassing moments during lectures.\
        What is the impact on you? He feels disconnected from the stories he once narrated with such passion, and it has shaken his confidence in front of his students.\
        What would you like to happen in the future? David hopes to write a historical novel, bringing together his immense knowledge and crafting an engaging narrative for readers.\
        How might we achieve this? Sarah, with her connection to the arts, is helping him structure the novel. Rachel, with her teaching experience, provides insights into what would resonate with younger readers.\
        What strengths and support networks do you have to help you? His daughters are his pillars, providing both emotional and practical support. The academic community, understanding of his condition, offers assistance, with fellow professors stepping in to help with lectures.'
