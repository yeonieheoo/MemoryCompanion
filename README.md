# MemoryCompanion

MemoryCompanion is a novel digital health solution that leverages Generative Pre-trained large-scale Transformer (GPT) technology, which is the underlying technology behind ChatGPT. MemoryCompanion offers a combination of speech-to-text transcription, voice-cloning, and talking-face technologies to create an efficient and immediate caregiving system for AD patients. The amalgamation of voice-cloning and talking-face methodologies in GPT responses allows AD patients to experience the sensation of conversing with cherished ones at their own leisure. As an efficacious and efficient caregiving alternative, MemoryCompanion sustains consistent quality and care for each patient, mitigating the protracted working hours, patient loads, labor intensity, and stress experienced by human caregivers. MemoryCompanion transcends the confines of AD, exhibiting applicability in diverse health domains including language, developmental, and mental health, as well as the educational sector, engendering a broader societal impact.

The overarching purpose of MemoryCompanion's design requirements entails the development of a sophisticated digital chatbot agent that accurately replicates the user's loved one's visage, tonal nuances, and linguistic style in order to prompt a natural conversation flow and maintain high authenticity in human-computer interaction. To accomplish this objective, MemoryCompanionâ€™s framework comprises four distinct components. The ensuing diagram elucidates the structure of MemoryCompanion, with numbers from (1) to (4) indicating each part.
